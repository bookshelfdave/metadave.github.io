      <description>Biography I am a software engineer in Buffalo, NY with a focus on backend + distributed systems. I currently work remotely for Mozilla as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer, where I design and run global cloud infrastructure for mozilla.org and MDN on Kubernetes. Previously, I worked at Chef, where I was a core engineer on Habitat and an engineering lead for Chef Analytics. I also worked at Basho on Riak multi data center replication.</description>
