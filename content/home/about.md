# Biography

I am a software engineer in Buffalo, NY with a focus on backend + distributed systems. I currently work remotely for [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) as a Site Reliability Engineer. Previously, I was an engineer at [Chef](http://www.chef.io), where I worked as a core engineer on [Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh). I also worked at [Basho](http://basho.com) on Riak [multi data center replication](http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/configuring/v3-multi-datacenter/).


I'm interested in the following languages: Rust, Erlang, D, OCaml, F#, C, Java, Go, Scala, Clojure, Haskell, R.
