Habitat is a new approach to automation that focuses on the application instead of the infrastructure it runs on. With Habitat, the apps you build, deploy, and manage behave consistently in any runtime — bare metal, VMs, containers, and PaaS. You'll spend less time on the environment and more time building features.

Habitat is an open source project, and we’d love for you to get involved.
